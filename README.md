Hello, I'm Nick Stagakis and I am interested in computer
vision applications (geometry and machine learning approaches) and I am currently learning about 
autonomous vehicles and self driving car perception using the Carla simulator. I'm looking forward to collaborating with people in the industry on improving
the localization and robustness of SLAM in autonomous vehicles. I also use this repo as a hub for my personal projects which may or may not be related to work.
